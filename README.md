## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of various maze generation and solving algorithms. Each algorithm is explained in detail, and the corresponding code is provided to help you understand how these algorithms work.

## Algorithms Implemented

### Maze Generation Algorithms

1. **Kruskal's Algorithm**: A graph-based algorithm that generates a maze by creating a minimum spanning tree.
2. **Iterative Recursive Backtracking**: A depth-first search algorithm that generates a maze by carving out paths.
3. **Wilson's Algorithm**: A loop-erased random walk algorithm that generates an unbiased maze.

### Maze Solving Algorithms

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: An algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: An algorithm that explores all the nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
3. **A\***: An algorithm that uses heuristics to find the shortest path from the start to the goal.
4. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: An algorithm that finds the shortest path from the start to all other nodes in the graph.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine and ensure you have Python installed.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/batuSenturk/Mazes.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Mazes
    ```

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python file. You can run these files to generate or solve mazes.

### Generating a Maze

To generate a maze using Kruskal's Algorithm, run:
```sh
python kruskal_maze.py
```


### Solving a Maze

To solve a maze using A*, run:
```sh
python a_star.py
```


### Examples
